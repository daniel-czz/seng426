4;Mental health research front and center at Neptune’ 8th annual Charity Golf Tournament;2019-04-20;"Neptune  Bank’s 18 annual Charity Golf Tournament saw another successful year, raising $300,500 for mental health research initiatives. The annual event hit a milestone this year as total funds raised by the annual event hit the $3 million mark.
With more than 200 participants, the sold-out tournament benefits the VGH Hospital Foundation, and raises funds to help support cutting-edge mental health research tailored to youth.
“Mental health research is more important than ever. With 10 to 20 per cent of Canadian youth affected by mental illness, 3.2 million Canadian teenagers are at risk of depression, but only one out of five youth in need of mental health services receive help,” says Edith Cressvan, President and CEO at Neptune Bank. “Mental illness impacts not only youth, but their friends and family too. With the money raised this year we are able to support research initiatives that will improve many lives.”
In addition to raising funds for mental health research through the tournament, Neptune Bank’s community investments support youth through its Youth Get It Community Investment Program. In 2018, the credit union invested $1.83M in community programs that help youth build a sense of community connection and decrease stress and depression.
Kamal Awad, Senior Vice President, Digital Solutions & Business Technology    and honourary chair of the 2019 tournament, stresses that the support of both individuals and businesses are crucial to the success of the tournament, held at Surrey’s Northview Golf and Country Club. He especially applauded the events sponsors, particularly the generous support of the event’s platinum sponsors: Desjardins, Landcor Data Corporation, PwC, SEI Industries Ltd, Valeyo and Worldsource Wealth Management.
“The fundraising success of this tournament would not be what it is without the amazing sponsor commitment we see year after year,” said Awad. “The sponsoring companies and participating golfers join us in a shared passion for raising awareness of mental health issues, advancing vital research, and helping young people and their families affected by mental illness.”";"Toronto, ON"
